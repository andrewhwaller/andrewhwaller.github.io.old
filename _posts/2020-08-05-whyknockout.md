title: Why Knockout?
---
Being a web developer is all about learning new stuff. One of the technologies I've had to learn in the context of my job is Knockout.js (https://knockoutjs.com/). Before I had to learn it for work, I had never even heard of Knockout. It's an older library (at least, by the standards of our current React-dominated context) that doesn't get too much hype these days. However, I wanted to discuss a few reasons why I think Knockout is still valuable for modern development.

1. Knockout is small

There's a ton of discussion these days about frameworks. Which JavaScript framework should you use? Which one is faster? Better? More performant? All of these are great questions. But sometimes you just don't need a framework! Knockout is a library; it doesn't demand that you submit to an entire system or way of doing things. It's simply a JavaScript library with specific code that helps developers create dynamic UIs. I know, I know, React is technically a library and not a framework, but the difference between using React's massive boilerplate-heavy infrastructure and using Knockout's more minimal, unobtrusive approach is noticeable!

2. Knockout is JavaScript

Knockout is JavaScript. Simple as that. There's a bit of special syntax to learn when it comes to getting the most out of Knockout's API, but for the most part, using Knockout is just like using any other JavaScript library. Knockout fits in right alongside your vanilla JavaScript. This is a huge advantage, since you don't need to change your paradigm when thinking about how to do things in Knockout. Vue, Angular, and React all have significant idiosyncrasies that have to be overcome when learning to use those tools. With Knockout, the number of idiosyncrasies lessens; if you know JavaScript, you can pick up Knockout very easily.

3. Knockout is freeing

I've recently been pretty into the JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup). This approach to building applications fits right in with Knockout: Simple, non-bloated client-side applications that consume APIs. Moreso than React or other frameworks, I can quickly and easily put together a clean frontend application and connect it to an API with just a couple classes and some Knockout-enabled HTML/CSS. That's awesome. Working with real HTML/CSS gives me plenty of control over my styling and makes the layout process easier. Knockout also has the ability to create complex interfaces if that's what the problem at hand requires. The freedom to choose simplicity or complexity and implement whatever I need using the same tool is great. No one tool is right for every job, but in the JavaScript-powered frontend world that we live in, Knockout sure covers a lot of bases.
